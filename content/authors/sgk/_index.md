I am a PhD research student at the **[Jeremiah Horrocks Institute](https://www.star.uclan.ac.uk)**, *[University of Central Lancashire](https://www.uclan.ac.uk)* as part of the [Galaxy Dynamics](https://www.star.uclan.ac.uk/~vpd/) research group led by Prof. Victor P. Debattista. My primary research is studying the formation and evolution of Box/Peanut bulges in barred-galaxies by comparing isolated and cosmological simulations to observations of external galaxies and the Milky Way.

My position is funded by the [Moses Holden](outreach/mholden) Studentship, dedicated to Lancashire astronomer and educator. I am currently a Junior Associate of the [LSST:UK Consortium](https://www.lsst.ac.uk) as part of the [Galaxies; Stars, Milky Way and Local Volume Science Collaboration](https://milkyway.science.lsst.org) and a member of the [N-Body Shop](https://nbody.shop/index.html). Part of my current [research](research), **Gough-Kelly et al. ([2022](publication/pmbs/))**, bridges these two memberships by making predictions for kinematic differences between populations within the Milky Way bulge.

I am also currently **Vice Chair** of the [Royal Astronomical Society](https://ras.ac.uk/) Early Career Network Steering Committee. Find out more about the network [here](https://ras.ac.uk/education-and-careers/early-career-network-meet-team).
