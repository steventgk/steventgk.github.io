A render of simulation 708Diff using pynbody.stars.render for 10 billion years of evolution. The model is a high resolution N-body+Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulation run with [Gasoline](https://gasoline-code.com) (Wadsley et al. 2004) of a galaxy which forms a bar which later dissolves. The simulations was run at the High Performance Computing Facility of the University of Central Lancashire by [Prof. Victor P. Debattistsa](https://www.star.uclan.ac.uk/~vpd/). This video was produced using the `pynbody.stars.render` function of [pynbody](https://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/).
