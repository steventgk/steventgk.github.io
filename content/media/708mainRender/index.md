A render of simulation run708main for 10 billion years of evolution. The model is a high resolution N-body+Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics simulation (gravity+gas) run with [Gasoline](https://gasoline-code.com) (Wadsley et al. 2004) of a barred galaxy which forms a Box-Peanut bulge similar to the Milky Way. The simulation was run at the High Performance Computing Facility of the University of Central Lancashire by [Prof. Victor P. Debattistsa](https://www.star.uclan.ac.uk/~vpd/). The model data is available at reasonable request. The rendering was produced using the `pynbody.stars.render` function of [pynbody](https://pynbody.github.io/pynbody/).
